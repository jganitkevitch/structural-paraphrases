Possessive rule:
[NP] ||| the [NNP,1] 's [NN,2] ||| the [NN,2] of the [NNP,1]

Dative shift:
give @NN to @NP # give @2 the @1 # @VP #

Passivization:
that @NP had @VBN#which was @2 by @1#@SBAR
which was @VBN by @NNP#that the @2 has @1#@SBAR

Adverbial phrase move:
@VBN @ADVP#is @2 being @1#@VP

Prepositional (can't generalize the transformation further due to SCFG):
the @NN by the @NN#the @2 @1#@NP
the @NNS from the @NNP#@2 @1#@NP

Reduced relative clause:
in order to @VB that#in order to @1#@SBAR/S
